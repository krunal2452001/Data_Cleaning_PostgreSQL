step 1: we will check all the missing values and null

step 4: update all null values
step 5: check if all things got updated or not( just run step 2 and we shoul get 0 
		rows as output so it got updated and run last query from step 1 just to double
		check)
step 6: check if we still have missing values reason is there is only 1 row for those 
		rows

/*
Lets handle missing value in "percentage_laid_off" and "total_laid_off" Now we will 
totaly delete the rows where both the column are null because its complately useless 
for us. But if we had 3rd rows like "total_employs" then we can do some math calculations
and fill the one empty row but in this case we cant. so we will drop all of those rows.
Reason 1: our analyis need those 2 rows a lot so we dont want any null values in those 2
reason 2: we dont have 3rd row using which we can fill these empty values.

Is it the best way to deal with data?
No, we should not delete data but in these case we dont have any option.
